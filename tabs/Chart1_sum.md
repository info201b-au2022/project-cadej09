## Summary
 My chart is applied to the question **Did the crime get worse or better during the years we suffered from COVID-19?**.
 I made my chart interactive so that you can slide the dates to change the range of the graph from the beginning of 2018 to October of 2022. By doing so you can filter out dates from before the pandemic began, which people consider as different dates.
