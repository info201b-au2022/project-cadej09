## Summary
 My chart is applied to the question **Did the crime get worse or better during the years we suffered from COVID-19?**.
 I made my chart interactive so that you can slide the dates to change the range of the graph from the beginning of 2018 to October of 2022. By doing so you can filter out dates from before the pandemic began, which people consider as different dates. If you want to look at crime later in the pandemic you can also filter out dates before then. The interactive chart helps users looking at the data by being able to choose their specific start date rather than being forced to guess where their start date may be and having to compare it to data beforehand.
